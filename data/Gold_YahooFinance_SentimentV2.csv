"Gold jumps above $5,500 as weak dollar is 'supercharging' rally","Gold hovered above $5,500 on Wednesday as a weaker dollar accelerated the debasement trade.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-jumps-above-5500-as-weak-dollar-is-supercharging-rally-205619795.html,2026-01-28 20:56:19+00:00,"Gold (GC=F) futures jumped above $5,500 per ounce on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, while a weaker dollar fueled the debasement trade, pushing investors toward hard assets. The greenback (DX-Y.NYB) stabilized on Wednesday after sliding to its lowest level since early 2022, as President Trump shrugged off concerns about a weakening currency. ""No, I think it’s great,” Trump said in Iowa on Tuesday when asked if he's worried about a declining dollar. Gold prices have rallied more than 20% year-to-date as the greenback has fallen against other currencies. ""Dollar weakness is supercharging the rise in gold ... adding fuel to the fire for the crazy rise in precious metals,"" said Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

""Unchecked fiscal debt creation continues to erode confidence in fiat currencies,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note on Wednesday. Hansen also pointed to growing odds on Polymarket that President Trump’s next pick for Fed chair could be Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s head of global fixed income, who favors aggressive rate cuts. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. During the press conference after the decision, Powell insinuated the run on precious metals does not mean the markets believe that policy makers have lost control of inflation or institutional credibility. ""If you look at where inflation expectations — our credibility is right where it needs to be,"" he said.

On Wednesday, President Trump said a “massive Armada is headed to Iran,” threatening military action unless Tehran agrees to negotiate. Elsewhere in the metals space, silver (SI=F) jumped as high as $116 per ounce Wednesday. The metal has surged roughly 50% since the start of the year in a fast rally. Strong demand from China and restrictions on silver exports have also helped lift prices. Meanwhile, platinum (PL=F) hovered near record highs Wednesday, gaining 29%. Copper (HC=F) prices were steady after topping $13,000 for the first time in London last week. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

Demand for gold could stand between 600 metric tons and 700 ‌metric tons, compared to 710.9 tons last year, which was the lowest in five years, Sachin Jain, chief executive of the WGC's Indian operations, told Reuters.

By contrast, investment demand rose 17% in 2025 to 280.4 tons, its highest since 2013, the WGC said. Investment demand accounted for a record roughly 40% ⁠of India's total gold consumption in 2025, up ​from a usual share of about a quarter.
